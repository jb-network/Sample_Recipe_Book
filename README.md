# Sample_Recipe_Book

This is challenge from the udmey course: "TOTAL Python: Become an Advanced Python Developer in 16 days"
The goal is to to build a sample Recipe Book to meet the course requirements.

Place the Zip file included in this package in the desire folder location.  The program will ask you where the Recipe folder is located. 

I know many things could be better, but I learned a lot.  I should have planned the program out better and I could have reused functions better.
